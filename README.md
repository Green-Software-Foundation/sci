# Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) Specification

A specification that describes how to calculate a carbon intensity score for software applications. 

Created and managed by the [Standards Working Group](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/standards_wg) in the [greensoftware.foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation).

## Project Scope
This document, the Software Carbon Intensity technical specification, describes how to calculate the carbon intensity of a software application. It describes the methodology of calculating the total carbon emissions and the selection criteria to turn the total into a rate that can be used to achieve real-world, physical emissions reductions, also known as abatement.

Electricity has a carbon intensity depending on where and when it is consumed. An intensity is a rate. It has a numerator and a denominator. A rate provides you with helpful information when considering how to design, develop, and deploy software applications. This specification describes the carbon intensity of a software application or service.

## Getting Started
- The development version of the specification is [here](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/blob/dev/Software_Carbon_Intensity/Software_Carbon_Intensity_Specification.md).
- The latest published version of the specification is [here](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/blob/main/Software_Carbon_Intensity/Software_Carbon_Intensity_Specification.md).
- The `dev` branch contains the current version that is being worked on and the `main` branch contains the latest published version.
- Check the [issues tab](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/issues) for active and closed conversations regarding the spec.

## Contributing
The recommended approach for getting involved with the specification is to:
- Read the [development version](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/blob/dev/Software_Carbon_Intensity/Software_Carbon_Intensity_Specification.md) of the specification.
- Raise an issue, question, or recommendation in the issues tab above and start a discussion with other members.
- Once agreement has been reached, then raise a pull request to update the specification with your recommended changes.
- Let others know about your pull request by either commenting on the relevant issue or posting in the Standards Working Group slack channel.
- Pull requests are reviewed and merged during Standards Working Group meetings.
- Only chairs of the Standards Working Group can merge pull requests.
