# eShoppen - SCI Case Study

## Overview

* The eShop Web application is a web application built on Asp.Net .It is built with monolithic architecture and follows MVC Design pattern
* The application uses a relational database for storing data 
* The business use cases built demonstrates a simplified eCommerce site.
* The case study focuses on calculating the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) value of the application using the [formula](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/blob/main/Software_Carbon_Intensity/Software_Carbon_Intensity_Specification.md#methodology-summary) as defined in the latest version of the [specification](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/blob/main/Software_Carbon_Intensity/Software_Carbon_Intensity_Specification.md)

The Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) is a rate, carbon emissions per one unit of R. The equation used to calculate the SCI value of a software system is:

`SCI = ((E * I) + M) per R`

Where:

- E = Energy consumed by a software system
- I = Location-based marginal carbon emissions
- M = Embodied emissions of a software system
- R = Functional unit (e.g. carbon per additional user, API-call, ML job, etc) 

All the elements in the SCI equation scale by the same functional unit of “R”

## Architecture

The architecture consists of the following components.
* App Service plan: An App Service plan provides the managed virtual machines (VMs) that host your app. All apps associated with a plan run on the same VM instances.

* App Service app: Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for creating and deploying cloud applications.

* Azure SQL Database: SQL Database is a relational database-as-a-service in the cloud. SQL Database shares its code base with the Microsoft SQL Server database engine. Depending on your application requirements, you can also use Azure Database for MySQL or Azure Database for PostgreSQL. These are fully managed database services based on the open-source MySQL Server and Postgres database engines.

We did Load Test runs with Azure App service Premium configuration with 2 core – 7 GB RAM and database server of Gen 5 Processor and  calculated the power consumed in these runs. The tests are meant to be a model only and can be extended to more infrastructure configurations. 

## (What) Software boundary

*Describe the components that are included in the software systems, if any major components are not included then please provide **reasons for exclusion**.*

### Included

* App server for the Web application
* Database server
* Front end browser  .This is the browser client on the device that is displaying the application to the end users on their desktop/mobile/laptop etc
 * Network traffic between browser client  and application server and back
 * Network traffic between application servers and databases. 

### Excluded

The following components and their carbon emissions have been excluded from the SCI calculation.
* Test infrastructure:  These include the load test resources that were used to simulate virtual users and http requests to the web server._Since the infrastructure and the associated energy usage do not fit into the same functional unit scale as defined in the SCI formula, these components will be excluded from the software’s SCI calculation. However the calculation for this infrastructure can be done in the same manner in which we have done for the production infrastructure with a different scaling factor_


## (Scale) Functional Unit

*Describe the [functional unit](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/blob/main/Software_Carbon_Intensity/Software_Carbon_Intensity_Specification.md#functional-unit-r) that best controls the scaling of the software system.*

The choice of functional unit applies to all components in your software boundary. 

R is 500 Users over a 1 hour period with 50 concurrent users

## (How) Quantification method

*For each software component in your software boundary, decide whether you are going to **measure** using real-world data or **calculate** an estimate via models, provide a reason and any useful details for each choice.

### App server for Web application

### Energy (`E`)

The Quantification method used for calculating energy value is **Calculate**. We are measuring CPU utilization of the app servers and then using a model based on the Thermal Design Power (TDP) of the processors, number of cores etc to **estimate** the power consumption.

The equation used to model the energy consumption is:

P[kwH] = (Power consumed by CPU or Pc Number of cores + Power consumed by Memory or Pr + Power consumed by GPU or Pg Number of GPUs)/1000

* CPU Utilization doesn’t scale linearly with power consumption, we will use the power curve as described in the [SCI Data Project “[E] Energy Estimation from Utilization Model” model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Viv94rMKH-fJrfD9Nn9_qkiAg1PDfIfJUAHRX9slG7A/edit#gid=526989613)

* From specs, we found that Power consumed by 4GB memory is close to 1.45 W and that by 8 GB memory is approximately 2.45 W. Also from this [article](https://medium.com/teads-engineering/estimating-aws-ec2-instances-power-consumption-c9745e347959) we can consider power consumed is approx 0.38 W/GB or close to 2.6 Watts.Since the energy values for memory are much lower than the calculated energy values for processors or CPUs, we consider these values negligible.

### Networking infrastructure 

The Quantification method for calculating energy emissions from Networking infrastructure is "Calculate". As part of the load test the Data in and Data out measurement of the App server and database server in GB are measured. This value is multiplied by the "Emissions/GB" data from SCI open data project. https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/sci-data/issues/13. 

The disclaimer here is : the above calculation assumes that the networking infrastructure does not emit any emissions where no data is transferred over the wire. This can be revisited in the future by having a similar concept to how we have TDP co-efficient for CPU utilization. 

## (Quantify) SCI Value Calculation
